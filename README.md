# landc
The land.c program exploits the Land Attack vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP SYN packet to a target system with the same source and destination IP and port. This causes the system to enter a loop, consuming resources and potentially crashing. It's a Denial of Service (DoS) attack targeting unpatched systems.
